title: Google Summer of Code 2020 with GNU Octave: JSON encode/decode
---

Hello there. In this blog post, I will describe my work with [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) during [Google summer of code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) 2020. I will also add links to the commits I have made and repositories I have worked on. Let's get started.

### About my project
JavaScript Object Notation, in short JSON, is a very common human readable and structured data format. My project aims to provide GNU Octave with a builtin support for that data format. 

Specifically, My project provides GNU Octave with two functions:
* `jsondecode`: This function decodes JSON-formatted strings into Octave objects.
* `jsonencode`: This function encodes Octave objects into JSON-formatted strings.

Having JSON support, Octave can improve for example its web service functions, which often exchange JSON data these days.

### My contribution to GNU Octave during GSoC 
For the past few months, Iâ€™ve been working with my mentors on my project. This work resulted in the following commits that were pushed into [the main repository of Octave](https://hg.savannah.gnu.org/hgweb/octave/):
* [5da49e37a6c9](https://hg.savannah.gnu.org/hgweb/octave/rev/5da49e37a6c9): This commit contains nearly all of my work during GSoC. It adds the functions `jsonencode` and `jsondecode` to GNU Octave.
* [aae9d7f098bd](https://hg.savannah.gnu.org/hgweb/octave/rev/aae9d7f098bd): This commit improves the integration of the functions into Octave's build system.
* [34696240591e](https://hg.savannah.gnu.org/hgweb/octave/rev/34696240591e): This commit improves the documentation of the functions. 
* [0da2fbd3a642](https://hg.savannah.gnu.org/hgweb/octave/rev/0da2fbd3a642): This commit improves the documentation of the functions.
* [174550af014f](https://hg.savannah.gnu.org/hgweb/octave/rev/174550af014f): This commit adds more tests and improves the documentation of the functions.

Those commits contain:
* The code of the two functions.
* Unit tests.
* Documentation (Doxygen documentation for the developers and Texinfo documentation for the users).
* Code to add the new functions to the build system.

I was working on this [stand-alone repository](https://github.com/Abdallah-Elshamy/Octave-GSoC-JSON) then at the final stages of GSoC, The code was moved to [my fork](https://github.com/abdallah-elshamy/octave) of the [Octave mirror on GitHub](https://github.com/mtmiller/octave). 

### How to use my project
As I said before, my project is already pushed to [the main repository of Octave](https://hg.savannah.gnu.org/hgweb/octave/). To use it, all you have to do is to build the default branch of Octave. This [article](https://wiki.octave.org/Building) shows how to do this.

### What to do after GSoC
A [benchmark](https://siko1056.github.io/blog/2020/08/19/gsoc2020-json-benchmark.html) was  implemented by [my mentor](https://github.com/siko1056) to assess the performance of the functions. The benchmark results showed that `jsondecode` has some performance issues. After some investigations, we were able to pinpoint what slows the performance which is `makeValidName` function. This function is written in Octave scripting language which is much slower than C++. So, I am going to rewrite the core of this function in C++ and make the m-file of `makeValidName` call it. This will definitely improve the performance of `jsondecode`.

 

Finally, I would like to say that I really had a wonderful experience during Google Summer of Code 2020 with GNU Octave and I am looking forward to contribute more in the future. Also, I would like to thank:
* The team of the Google Summer of Code program for supporting such an amazing experience.
* The community of GNU Octave for helping me during this wonderful journey.
* [My co-mentors and my mentor](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6263027378159616) for providing me with continuous support and help that facilitated my work a lot. It has been my pleasure to get to know you.
